.                            Attributes
.  
. In this window, you can display and, to a certain extent, change the
. attributes of the current screen object. The header includes:
.  
.                  - Graphical type
.                  - Name
.                  - Contents
.                  - Icon name and quick-info
.                  - Position
.                  - Size
.                  - Group assignment
.                  - Function code and type (pushbuttons only)
.  
. By clicking on the three checkboxes below, you can access the remaining
. field attribute classes. These are:
.  
.                  - Dictionary attributes
.                  - Program attributes
.                  - Display attributes
.  
. or specific attribute classes for TabStrips, Subscreen areas, and Table
. Controls.
.  
. Whether you can change the attributes or not depends on the field type
. and the current mode (change or display). Modifiable texts are identified
. by their darker background. Non-modifiable checkboxes are displayed in
. normal intensity.
. Although selecting an attribute checkbox makes that attribute immediately
. effective, you must confirm text input such as name or field texts by
. pressing ENTER.
.  
. Note: Field attributes can also be displayed and, if necessary, changed
.       in the field list. In the ABAP/4 part of the Screen Painter, you 
.       can find further help information about the individual attributes.
