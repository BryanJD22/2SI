. 
.                              Field list
.  
. On this screen, you can display and, if required, change the attributes
. of all screen elements. These attributes are identical to those on the
. "Attributes" screen. You can find help information about the individual
. attributes on the attributes screen or the field list of the alphanumeric
. Screen Painter.
.  
. The field list is divided into five attribute groups. The first group
. contains two columns for the element type and the element name. The
. element type is represented by an icon. If you move over one of these
. icons, the relevant text for the element type is displayed. If you
. double-click on the icon, the "Attributes" screen of the corresponding
. screen element will be displayed. A screen element that is a container
. for other elements has a +/- marker next to the icon. If you double-click
. that marker the contained elements will be added to, or removed from the 
. list.
.  
. As in the "Attributes" screen, the remaining four attribute groups
. contain:
.  
. - General attributes
. - Dictionary attributes
. - Program attributes
. - Display attributes
.  
. These groups are displayed in a scrollable screen. By using the "-" or
. "+" keys below the group names, you can either hide or show the groups.
.  
. Whether the attributes can be changed or not depends on the element type
. and current mode (i.e. change or display). Modifiable texts and
. checkboxes have a white background, unmodifiable texts a gray background.
.  
.  
. Setting a checkbox makes the relevant attribute immediately effective,
. but text entries such as the name or element text must be activated by
. pressing ENTER.
.  
.  
. Selecting and Deselecting
. -------------------------
. Clicking on a line in the field list selects this line and deselects any
. previously selected lines. The line selection column on the left allows
. you to select a single line or several lines.
. You can select/deselect several lines as follows:
.  
. - CTRL  + mouse button selects/deselecte a single line
. - SHIFT + mouse button selects/deselects all lines between the clicked
.            line and the line last selected.
.  
.  
. Input focus and key navigation
. -------------------------------
. The input focus is a flashing cursor for text input fields and a dotted
. rectangle for checkboxes. You can change the input focus by clicking the
. mouse or by pressing the following keys on your keyboard:
.  
. - "Arrow up" switches the focus to the field above, if possible.
. - "Arrow down" switches the focus to the field below.
. - "TAB" switches the focus to the next field on the right which is
.    ready for input.
. - "SHIFT + TAB" switches the focus the next field on the left which
.    is ready for input.
. - "CTRL + TAB" switches the focus to the top of the next group.
. - "SHIFT + CTRL + TAB" switches the focus to the next element.
