.                        DDIC/program fields
.  
. This window allows you to use Data Dictionary table fields or (table)
. fields from the generated version of the associated program (module pool
. or report).
.  
. With Data Dictionary fields, you can use both input/output fields 
. (templates) and/or texts (key words). With program fields, you can use 
. only input/output fields.
.  
. In the window header line, you first specify the table or field name. You
. can specify field names generically, but not table names.
.  
. The pushbuttons Get from Dict and Get from program trigger the search for
. the table or field either in the Data Dictionary or in the program.
.  
. The list boxes display the found fields including the name, format,
. length, and text. The text depends upon whether "Input/Output field" or 
. "Text" has been selected:
.  
. - None:               Short text (comment); Data Dictionary fields only
. - Input/output field: Input/output template (default with program fields).
. - Text:               Short, medium or long text or header of data element
.                       to which table field refers; Data Dictionary fields 
.                       only.
.  
. By clicking and dragging in the lists, you can select single or several
. consecutive entries.
.  
. Note: "Modified" selection (CTRL or SHIFT & mouse button) even allows
.       you multiple selection with gaps.
.  
. After you have selected from the list and selected Transfer, the system
. transfers to the screen those field components specified by the switch.
.  
. Fields which 
.        - are blank (no text),
.        - are not allowed on screens or
.        - already exist on the screen,
. have thin script. If the selection contains such fields, an error message
. is displayed when you select Transfer and the fields are automatically
. eliminated from the selection.
. By selecting Transfer again, you can copy the remaining fields to the
. screen.
.  
. By clicking on (and sometimes moving) them in the fullscreen editor, you
. then determine where you want the selected fields to be located. If you
. have selected several fields, they are located as a compact group and
. must then be moved separately.
.  
. If collisions with other fields occur, an error message is displayed and
. you must repeat the transfer, possibly in several steps.
.  
. Note: The Reset key in the Create palette of the fullscreen
.       window allows you to cancel the transfer of Dict/program fields
.       before locating takes place.
