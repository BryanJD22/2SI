.  
.                          Dictionary/program fields
.  
. On this screen, you can reference table fields from the ABAP Dictionary
. or fields from the generated version of the relevant program (module pool
. or report).
.  
. You can copy fields from the ABAP Dictionary to the screen as input/
. output fields (templates) and/or text fields (key words). Fields from a
. program can of course only be used as input/output fields.
.  
.  
. Selecting the table
. -------------------
. In the screen header line, you first specify the table name or field
. name. You can specify field names generically, but not table names.
.  
. The pushbuttons Get from Dict. and Get from program allow you to search
. for the table or field in the ABAP Dictionary or in the program.
.  
.  
. Displaying the fields
. ---------------------
. The found fields are displayed in a tabular list containing the following
. elements:
.  
. - Field name
. - Short text (ABAP Dictionary fields only),
. - Format and length of input/output template
. - Length of 4 texts (short, medium, long and header - ABAP Dictionary 
.   fields only)
. - Currently selected text
.  
. If the field name is too long to be displayed in its entirety, you can
. still view it in full by clicking on the field name. The same applies to
. the short text and the field text.
.  
. Note: When searching for table fields in the list, you can enter the
.       field name in the input field and choose Find in list.
.       The system then shifts the list up/down until the field name
.       beginning with the character string you entered becomes the
.       first entry.
.  
.  
. Selecting and copying fields
. ----------------------------
. To select and copy fields, you must be in change mode.
.  
. You can choose the field components you want for each line individually
. by using the checkboxes and radio buttons. If you choose an input/output
. field of the type CHAR with length 1, you can use one of the last three 
. radio buttons Copy as text, Copy as checkbox, Copy as radio button to 
. specify whether you want to copy a field as a text element, as a checkbox 
. or as a radio button - if required, together with its text.
.  
. If the input/output field already exists on the screen, the relevant
. checkbox is selected and no further input is possible. If one of the
. field texts already exists on the screen, the relevant radio button is
. set.
.  
. The selection column on the left allows you to select single lines or
. blocks of lines for transfer to the screen. A red cross is displayed if
. you have not chosen at least one field component on the line. As long as
. any line is highlighted in this way, you cannot transfer any fields.
.  
. Fields which are
.  
. - blank (i.e. have no text),
. - not allowed on screens or
. - already exist on the screen (input/output field and text),
.  
. become inactive and cannot be selected for transfer to the screen. In
. this case, the selection button shows a lock.
.  
. When you press Copy, the chosen field components are copied to the
. screen. By clicking (and, if necessary, moving) the elements in the
. fullscreen editor, you can define exactly where you want these fields to
. be displayed. If you copy several fields, they are placed together as a
. group. You must then place them accordingly.
.  
. If the system cannot place fields on the screen so that they do not
. collide with each other, a message is displayed. You must then repeat the
. transfer of these fields to another position in the fullscreen editor.
.  
. Note: In the "Create" palette of the fullscreen editor, you can use
.       the reset key, to cancel the transfer of Dictionary/program
.       fields before they are placed on the screen.
.  
.  
. Sorting a table by field name
. -----------------------------
. You can select the column of the field name by clicking on the button
. below the header. To start the sort, press the left button in the
. application toolbar below the table.
.  
.  
. Switching on checkboxes / radio buttons of a column
. ---------------------------------------------------
. You can switch on all checkboxes / radio buttons of a table column in a
. single operation (checkboxes can also be switched off in the same way).
. To do this, you select the appropriate column by clicking on the button
. below the header. You then switch on (or off) using the pushbuttons in
. the application toolbar. If no line is selected, the switching on (off)
. process applies to the entire line.
.  
.  
. Input focus and key navigation
. -------------------------------
. The input focus is indicated by a dotted rectangle. You can change the
. focus either by clicking with the mouse or by pressing the appropriate
. keys on your keyboard:
.  
. - "TAB" switches the focus to the next field on the right which is
.    ready for input.
. - "SHIFT + TAB" switches the focuse to the next field on the left which
.    is ready for input.
. - "CTRL + TAB" switches the focus to the top of the next group.
. - "SHIFT + CTRL + TAB" switches the focus to the next element.
.  
. Within the table, you can also use the arrow keys.
