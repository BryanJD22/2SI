.                          Fullscreen Editor
.  
. The fullscreen editor is the main window of the Graphical Screen Painter. 
. In addition to the usual menu components (menu bar, standard tool bar,
. application tool bar and message line), it contains an input area for
. creating and changing a screen.
.  
.  
. Program name as well as screen number and type can be found in the window's
. title bar, while the screen size can be found in the window's status bar. 
. If you are in change mode, you can increase or reduce the screen size by 
. "clicking and dragging" the frame surrounding the input area.
.  
. The header line contains the name, text, size and position of the
. currently selected screen element. The contents of these entry fields may
. be changed to modify the respective attribute of the screen element.
.    
. To the left of the screen, you see the palette of possible screen
. elements. The icons in this palette work just like pushbuttons and are
. used to create new screen elements. From top to bottom, these include:
.  
.                - Reset button
.                - Text field (Key word)
.                - Input/output field (template)
.                - Check box
.                - Radio button
.                - Pushbutton
.                - TabStrip
.                - Frame
.                - Subscreen area
.                - Table Control
.                - Status icon.
.
. The Reset button allows you to cancel the operation once you have
. started creating a new element. Creating new screen elements is 
. described below in the section "Editing screen elements".
.  
. Note: The input area itself does not actually allow any text input.
.       Instead, you can modify the text of the currently selected screen 
.       element by entering or changing the string in text entry field.
.  
.  
. Further help
. ------------
. The Help menu also provides explanatory notes about the other Screen 
. Painter windows. You reach these windows by selecting, for instance,
. Goto -> attributes or Goto -> DDIC/program fields, or by pressing the
. appropriate keys in the application tool bar.
.  
.  
. Editing screen elements
. -----------------------
. * Selecting and deselecting
. By clicking once on the left mouse button in the input area, you can
. select individual screen elements for editing. The tab and backtab keys
. allow you to select the next or previous element and thus run through the
. screen elements from left to right moving down the screen or the other way
. round.
. 
. By "lassoing", you can select several elements at the same time. To do
. this, you press the left mouse button in the blank area of the screen and
. pull on the right corner until all the desired elements are surrounded.
. 
. You can select individual elements either for or from such a group by
. clicking on the left mouse button at the same time as you hold down the
. CTRL or SHIFT key (this is known as modified selection).
. 
. To deselect the currently selected elements, click on the mouse in the
. blank area of the screen or select Edit -> Deselect.
.  
. * Move
. To move an element, select by clicking on the left mouse button. Keep the
. button depressed as you drag the element to the desired position and then
. release (this is known as "drag and drop"). If collisions occur, the
. outline of the elements concerned are highlighted and a suitable message
. appears in the message line.
.  
. * Enlarging and reducing
. You can change the width and height of screen elements by clicking and
. dragging. To do this, you direct the mouse pointer towards the right or
. lower edge of the selected element until the pointer symbol changes to a
. direction arrow. There, you click on the element and move the edge in the
. desired direction by keeping the mouse button depressed. Collisions with
. other elements are also highlighted here.
.  
. * Create
. To create a new screen element, you select the appropriate icon from the
. "Create" palette on the left screen edge and place the new element on the
. screen by clicking and dragging.
. 
. When placing an element, clicking on the mouse defines the position of the
. upper left corner of the screen element. By dragging and keeping the mouse
. button depressed, you can define the size of the element. If this collides
. with another screen element right at the start position, you must move the
. new element to a different position. There, it is created in its minimal
. size and must then be enlarged, if necessary, as described above.
. 
. Before placing the element, you can cancel the "Create" operation by
. pressing the same icon or by pressing the "Reset" pushbutton, i.e. the
. topmost button in the palette.
.   
. * Defining and dissolving step loops and graphical groups
. Step loops are vertical repetitions of loop blocks, which may contain
. input/output fields, texts, check boxes and radio buttons. Radio
. buttons within a step loop ("vertical" radio buttons) are implicitly
. dependent on each other in that activating one deactivates another. With
. all other groups of radio buttons, you must define this logical
. connection explicitly by making use of the graphical group.
. 
. Step loops and graphical groups are not created like elements, but are
. "defined" as a group by combining several elements together. To do this
. for the selected elements, select Edit -> Group -> Step loop/GraphGroup
. -> Define. 
. 
. At first, a new step loop has a minimum of two loop block repetitions and
. a width depending on the the width of the group. You can modify the
. number of repetitions by clicking and dragging the lower step loop edge.
. A loop block can also contain a graphical group of radio buttons. In this
. context, however, only the radio buttons of one repetition depend on each
. other ("horizontal" radio buttons).
. 
. To "dissolve", i.e. break up the groups, select Edit -> Step loop/
. GraphGroup -> Dissolve.
. 
. Note: Step loops have become obselete after the introduction of the
.       Table Control, which may contain the same types of screen elements
.       as a step loop.
.    
. * Delete
. To delete, mark the element or element group and select Edit -> Delete 
. or use the pushbutton Delete (F14). If you delete an element 
. inadvertently you can undo this action until another operation changes
. the screen contents (see below).
.
. Note: When you delete a frame, only the frame itself is deleted; the
.       elements within remain unchanged. However, if you delete a 
.       container such as a TabStrip or a Table Control, the elements
.       within the container will be deleted as well.
